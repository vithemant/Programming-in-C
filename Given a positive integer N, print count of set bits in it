Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. For example, if the given number is 6(binary: 110), output should be 2 as there are two set bits in it.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each testcase contains single line of input containing the N.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print count of set bits in it.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106

Example:
Input:
2
6
11
Output:
2
3

SOLUTION:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int T; /*  T is number of Testcases */
	scanf("%d",&T);
	while(T>0)
	{
	    T--;
	    int n,count=0; /* "n" is the integer N and "count" is the number of set bit */
	    scanf("%d",&n);  
	    while(n>0)
	    {
	        if(n%2==1)
	        count++;
	        n=n/2;
	    }
	    printf("%d \n",count);
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
